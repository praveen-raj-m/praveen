      <h2>May 2021 - Aug 2021</h2>
      <h2>OPTIMIZATION OF SOLAR THERMAL SYSTEM</h2>
      <p>
      
      Selected one among 100 students from a pool of 3000+ applicants. 
       Worked with Dr.Patrick Phelan on Optimizing Solar Thermal System using meta-heuristic algorithms.
    Optimized the design variables of the system using Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization.
     Compared both the algorithms using metrics such as computation time, 
     convergence time and concluded that PSO gave better performance.

      <h2>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
      <p>
        Working with a team to improve user flexibility of Ansys Software. 
        Ansys is a software used to simulate computer models of structures, electronics, fluid flow, etc.
        We are developing a user-friendly voice operational GUI for Ansys, 
        that can be guided by users easily through voice commands to create and simulate structures.

      <h2> OPTIMIZATION AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
      <p>
        Worked with Dr.Rajasekar Elangovan and developed a software for optimizing Energy Plus simulations.
        It incorporates various optimization algorithms (eg: Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization)
           that searches the design space for high performing parameters quickly.
        Built a fully functional GUI using PyQt5 and deployed it using pyinstaller.

      <p>
        Selected as a research intern in Space System Laboratory, IIIT Delhi.
        Worked on Orbit Prediction using ensembled Deep Learning techniques with Dr.Sanat Biswas and team.
        Analysed and developed different deep learning architectures (Eg: ensemble neural net, LSTMs ) 
          using time series data from stellites.

      <h2>SECURITY OF DEEP LEARNING NETWORKS</h2>
      <p>
        Worked with Dr.Sparsh Mittal on the security of Deep Neural Networks.
       Performed Bit Flip attack on various quantized deep neural networks
        (eg VGG, Alexnet, Resnet18, mobilenetv2, densenet161 ) to analyze the effect of quantization on accuracy after attack.
       Researched on solutions to improve the accuracy of attacked networks, 
          prevent the attack from affecting the network too much itself.

      <h2>DATA VISUALIZATION AND MACHIME</h2>
      <p>
        Shared and executed ideas in an interactive environment as part of an interdisciplinary development team.
        Data from internal and external sources was collected, and used BI tools such as Tableau,
         PowerBI to analyze and visualize the data. 
        Then, built and tuned supervised and unsupervised machine learning models using  Python, and sci-kit learn.
